Project Overview: C# to JavaScript Conversion

This project involves converting an existing C# application into JavaScript while maintaining the original structure and functionality. The conversion process focuses on proper JavaScript syntax, conventions, and best practices including:

- Converting C# properties to JavaScript getters/setters
- Following JavaScript naming conventions
- Implementing proper module structure
- Maintaining object-oriented principles

The goal is to create a functionally equivalent JavaScript application that follows modern ECMAScript standards.
